# Locating-Rogue-SSIDs-with-Kismet
A basic signals intelligence project

## Scope
This project demonstrates how to use Kismet and a simple WiFi adapter card to locate rogue SSIDs within a given proximity.

## Resources
### Hardware
* Laptop with Linux (Kali is most convenient due to preinstalled dependencies)
* Alfa AWUS036ACH WiFi Adapater

### Software
* Aircrack-NG
* Kismet
